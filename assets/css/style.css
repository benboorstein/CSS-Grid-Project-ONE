/* Note that because of the varying border sizes in the painting (to see the painting, uncomment out the '.wrapper' background image and the 'div' opacity setting), the borders that we set (with 'grid-gap' in our CSS) won't EXACTLY match the painting, and this throws things off by a bit. But no big deal for this exercise. Note, though, that using 'grid-column-gap' and 'grid-row-gap', each with its own value, instead of 'grid-gap' for both values, would probably be a solution here */
